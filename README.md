# HW15 for Rutger's Coding Bootcamp
## Clicky Game

This is the first React.js app built for the boot camp.  It is a simple game, with a grid of images that the user can click on. One point is awarded for each unique image clicked on. Scoring restarts if the user clicks on an image more than once. There are 10 images on the screen, so the objective is to reach a score of 10.

**Hosting:** app is hosted on Github pages and can be accessed [here](https://DriDoherty.github.io/clickygame)
